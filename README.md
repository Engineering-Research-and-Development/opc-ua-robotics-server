# OPC UA Robotics Compation Specification - MotionDeviceSystem Server
Implementation of the OPC UA Robotics Companion Specification part 1 of n.
Part 1 includes a basic description of a motion device system and has the main scope to push out condition data of a motion device system vertically into higher level manufacturing systems (e. g. line PLC, MES; Cloud) for information and diagnostic purposes. Subsequent parts will extend the basic robotics description and cover other use cases, e. g. to configure and control a motion device system or the included motion devices.
